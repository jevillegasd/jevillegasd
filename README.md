### Hey!  ðŸ‘‹

My name is Juan Villegas. I'm a researcher working in photonics, specializing in integrated optical circuit design.

In the first part of the 10s, I worked as a high speed boat designer, and slowly moved into the reseacrh of electrical and electronic systems onboard ships, and then quickly moved into photonic research when I started graduate school at the Masdar Institute, in Abu Dhabi. I completed my masters in Microsystems Engineering from Khalifa University working with professor Marcus Dahlem on the study of materials for planar optical systems. Later I started a PhD in Electrical Engineering at NYU, working with professor Mahmoud Rasras. Here I work on many projects in photonics, including laser fault injection on chips, inverse design, high speed modulators and photodetectors, and physical layer security in optical networks.

Projects I have worked on trough the years include the study of materials for integrated optics and solar cells, integration of 2D materials with silicon photonics, silicon physical unclonable functions, polarization encryption and more to come.

For more information on some of my academic projects check out my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mnVyrwYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) profile.
